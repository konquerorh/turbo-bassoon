# Machine Learning
## Machine Learning Major Types
### Supervised learning
* what it is
   * An algorithm uses training data and feedback from humans to learn the relationship of given input to a given output, aiming to predict the output giving new data set. 
* when to use it
   * You know how to classify the input data and the type of behavior you want to predict, but you need the algorithm to caculate it for you on new data. 
* how it works
  1. A human labels the input data and fefine the output variable. 
  1. The algorithm is  trained on the data to find the connection between input and output.
  1. Once training is complete - typically when the algorithm is sufficiently accurate - the algorigthm is applied on new data. 
* Algorigthms / business cases
  1. Linear regression
  1. Logistic regression
  1. Linear/quadratic discriminant analysys (Upgrade a logistic regression to deal with non-linear problems, where the change to the input variables do not result in propotional change to the outpu variables.  
  1. Decision tree
  1. Naive Bayes
### Unsupervised learning

### Reinforced learning
