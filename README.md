# Machine Learning

## Machine Learning Major Types
### Supervised learning
* what it supervised learning
  *It is An algorithm uses training data and feedback from humans to learn the relationship of given input to a given output, aiming to predict the output giving new data set. 
* when to use it
   * You know how to classify the input data and the type of behavior you want to predict, but you need the algorithm to caculate it for you on new data. 
* how it works
#  1. A human labels the input data and fefine the output variable. 
  1. The algorithm is  trained on the data to find the connection between input and output.
2  1. Once training is complete - typically when the algorithm is sufficiently accurate - the algorigthm is applied on new data. 
#* Algorigthms / business cases
  1. Linear regression
  1. Logistic regression

1. Linear/quadratic discriminant analysys (Upgrade a logistic regression to deal with non-linear problems, where the change to the input variables do not result in propotional change to the outpu variables.  
  1. Decision tree
1. Naive Bayes
### Unsupervised learning
```Python
#if a == b: 
  print(a)
```

### Reinforced learning

## Features of AI
1. Automates
(1. Personalizes
  Sample: recomendation
   * Behaviours 
   * Tags
1. Optimises
1. Detects anomalies
1. Forecasts
1. Innovates

## GDPR Principles
1. Explicit consent
1. Right to be forgotten
1. Data portability
1. Algorithm tranpency

## Investment Areas
### What is the strategy of CITI in AI 
1. Create access to data
1. Plateform to document the algorithm explanation to meet the regulatory requirement
1. Production and explainability - ML OPS

## What is AI vs ML spectrum, Any framework to understand the nuanances and differences
1. Generalization of the learning result (AI)

## NLP
1. Tokenization
Is the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent. 
2. Acronym normalization
Acronym normalization is the process of transforming text into single cononical formal that it might not have had before. 
3. Lemmatization 
   Lemmztization is the process of group together the inflected forms of a word so they can be anzlyzed as a single item, dentified by the word lemma. 
4. Sentence and phrase boundaries 
Is the process to determine sentence boundaries, and split text into sentences. 
### Text extraction
1. Named entity recognition / entity extraction 
2. Content Categorisation
Categorise around trends.. what's trending, positivie or negative, sentiment analysis
3. Content Clustering
Identify main topics of discourse, discovery of emergent topcis
4. Fact extraction 
To fill databases with structured information
5. Relationship extraction
To fill out graph databases
6. Summarization
7. Similarity
8. Fact extraction
